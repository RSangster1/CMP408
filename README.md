This module required the usage of a Raspberry Pi, Amazaon Web services and Kernal Modules.
The raspberry pi when prompted will collect it's own hardware information such as Memory, disk space and temperature.
Rsync command would ssh to an ec2 instance on AWS and upload the data.
The instance also held a webpage which could display the data to the user.
After uploading the data the kernal module would activate and led connected to the pi to light up red for failure and green for success.
